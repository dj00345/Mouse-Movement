# Mouse Game Recreation 
these are just some samples of code snippets from a Recreation Project that was done as a class project.
the point of the assignment was to create a game. my group decided to instead try and Recreate a game. 
We succedded in recreating the game, and also added in some humor for death scenes and added in new features to the game
Including: zoomed in, radar, create level.

in this i have code snippets from the mouse movement and code that i created for the create level screen.
